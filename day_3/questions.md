## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
A conditional statement is a statement where you set a rule that if true, code will run, if not true, the code in the statement will not run. Examples are: if, elsif, and else
1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
To run a piece of code, only if something is true, and avoid running it if it isn't.
1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
if, then the conditional statement, the code block, then end of the statement of no elsifs or else is being used.
1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
By either using logical operators like && or || or by adding additional conditions with elsif and else
1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
if (condition here)
    code block here for if
elsif (new condition here)
    code block here for elsif if if isn't true
else (new condition here if wanted, but can be left blank as it will only run if the other two aren't true)
    code block
end

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
To check multiple pieces of data against each other.
